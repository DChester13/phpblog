#Problem Solving and Being Lazy

In many ways effective programming consists of but two concepts: problem solving and being lazy. Sounds easy right? Let's break this down.

##Problem Solving

As with just about any task, programming tasks - from the most complex to the most mundane - are easier when broken down into smaller, more managable tasks. In solving some problems you may be faced with **meta-problems** in order to solve it, and in each case you'd be surprised how many questions have to be answered in order to solve a programming problem. Consider a piece of code that produces the square root of an inputted number, a seemingly simple task:

* What is a square root?
* How do you calculate square roots?
* What language are you using?
* How do you peform square root operations in this language?
* What output are you trying to produce?
* How are you going to output it?
* How are you going to get an input from the user?

And so the list goes on.

You'll find there are many types of problems that will be encountered that, and this will determine how you'll have to go about solving it. For example if this is a group project deciding which language to use will be a **shared problem**, whereas deciding which editor to use will be an **individual problem**, and these will have to be tackled differently.

##Being Lazy

It sounds crazy, but being lazy is quite a virtue in the programming world. Don't do more work than you have to! Making an efficient program is all about writing as little code as possible. This doesn't, however, mean you should cut corners!

If someone has already written it, don't write it again - chances are someone on the internet has already done what you're trying to do.
